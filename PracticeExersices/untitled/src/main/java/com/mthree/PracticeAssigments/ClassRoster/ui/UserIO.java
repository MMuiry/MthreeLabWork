//This interface defines the methods that must be implemented by any class that wants to directly interact with the user interface technology.
//We will implement a console-based user interface in the code-along. You could image, however, an implementation that used a windowing system or some other technology.
//Again, each class would be different but all would implement the same interface, ensuring that they are all well encapsulated.
//Note that the ClassRosterView only uses this interface to interact with the user — it is completely unaware of the implementation details.
